Hey there! I’m Chase, and I’m diving headfirst into full-stack development, learning all the ins and outs of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and SQL. I’m totally hooked on creating things that actually work and look great on the web.

What I’m Up To
Right now, I’m juggling a bunch of personal projects that bring together front-end design and back-end logic. I’m all about learning by doing, so each project is a chance to level up and tackle new tech.

Always Learning
I’m all in on picking up new skills—whether it's a fresh framework, some cool design tricks, or new ways to build smarter, cleaner code. I love a good challenge, and I’m always looking to grow.
